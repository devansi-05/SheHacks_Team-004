## What you know about your skin?

Your skin is the organ that comes into contact with the rest of the world. It holds body fluids in, preventing dehydration, and keeps harmful microbes out—without it, we would get infections. Your skin is full of nerve endings that help you feel things like heat, cold, and pain. If you couldn’t feel these things, you could get badly hurt and not even know it!

## Why is healthy skin important?

Since your skin plays such an important role in protecting your body, you should keep it as healthy as you can. This will help you keep from getting sick or having damage to your bones, muscles, and internal organs.

## Skin diseases

There are many diseases that can affect your skin. Some like vitiligo cause the skin to lose its natural color, and some like alopecia areata can make the hair fall out. Another skin disease like epidermolysis bullosa can cause painful blisters. Psoriasis can cause itchy, scaly red patches. Go see your doctor if you think you might have a skin disease.

## What challenges our project overcomes?
